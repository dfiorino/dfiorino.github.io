title:  Introduction to Machine Learning @ IIHE, Brussels
---

I recently gave an machine learning workshop for my astroparticle group at the IIHE in Brussels.
The main goal was to provide an introductory lecture on the terminology, mechanics, and applications of machine learning algorithms,
including a simple Keras scripting tutorial to get students started running over their own physics data sets.


The main topics covered include:
- Classical programming vs. machine learning
- Supervised machine learning
- Building blocks of ML algorithms
- More complex models
- Keras tutorial


The slides for this talk can be found [here](https://zhampel.github.io/intro-ml-iihe/).
