Ultimate frisbee has been a passion on mine since high school. As the sport enters prominence, I have
been able to leverage play-by-play data to further my technical skills while continuing to participate
in the ultimate frisbee community!
<br>
For this purpose, I've created <strong>SOTG Stats</strong> - a media account to share my work on analyzing
and visualizing ultimate frisbee data. Through SOTG Stats, I have:
<br>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
    Created <strong>AUDL-Pull</strong> - a super user-friendly Python project for extraction of ultimate
    frisbee data. The project is open-source on Github and includes tutorials for data exploration using Pandas.

    Published an article on Ultiworld, a small media company focused on covering ultimate frisbee.

    Posted over 100 graphics and insights and collected 700 followers on my social media accounts.
