## SOTG Stats
Ultimate frisbee has been a passion on mine since high school.
I've leveaged that passion to further my technical skills
by creating <strong>SOTG Stats</strong> - a media account to 
share my work on analyzing and visualizing ultimate frisbee data:
<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p> Created <a href="https://github.com/dfiorino/audl-pull">AUDL-Pull</a> 
    - a super user-friendly Python project for extraction and analysis of 
    ultimate frisbee data. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Became an <a href="https://ultiworld.com/author/dfiorino/">author on Ultiworld</a>, a small media company focused on ultimate frisbee. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Posted over 100 graphics and insights and collected 700 followers on my
social media accounts. (<a href="https://twitter.com/sotgstats">Twitter</a>,<a
href="https://www.instagram.com/statsofthegame">Instagram</a>,<a href="https://www.facebook.com/sotgstats/">Facebook</a>) </p>
  </li>
</ul>
