Ultimate frisbee has been a passion on mine since high school. As the sport enters prominence, I have
been able to leverage play-by-play data to further my technical skills while continuing to participate
in the ultimate frisbee community!
<br>
<br>
For this purpose, I've created <strong>SOTG Stats</strong> - a media account to share my work on analyzing
and visualizing ultimate frisbee data. Through SOTG Stats, I have:
<br>
<br>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p> Created <a href="https://github.com/dfiorino/audl-pull"><strong>AUDL-Pull</strong></a> - a super user-friendly Python project for extraction of ultimate
    frisbee data. The project is open-source on Github and includes tutorials for data exploration using Pandas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Became an <a href="https://ultiworld.com/author/dfiorino/">author on Ultiworld</a>, a small media company focused on covering ultimate frisbee. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Posted over 100 graphics and insights and collected 700 followers on my
social media accounts. (<a href="https://twitter.com/sotgstats">Twitter</a>,<a

  </li>
</ul>
