## Cosmic-Ray Energy Spectrum

![image-left](/assets/images/bdt-small.png){: .align-right} Cosmic rays are charged particles
(e.g. protons, alpha particles, iron nuclei, etc.) originating from outer space. I focus on
 applying unfolding (deconvolution) techniques to data collected with the IceCube South Pole Neutrino Observatory to study the composition of cosmic-rays at high energies. 
A better  understanding of the cosmic-ray energy spectrum can help answer fundamental questions related to the origin of cosmic rays.
