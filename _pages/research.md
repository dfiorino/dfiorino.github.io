## Cosmic-Rays with HAWC

Cosmic rays are charged particles that are born in the some most violent environments in our Universe. 
The cosmic rays that arrive at Earth are primarly composed of protons and alpha particles, with elements up to iron nuclei 
(and some heavier elements in trace amounts) in the mix.
By studying the energy spectrum, arrival distribution, and composition of these particles, we can learn more about
the origins of cosmic rays and the environments in which they travel to reach us.
Ultimately, it is by understanding these smallest consituents of matter that we can get a better picture of the largest structures in our Universe.

My PhD research focused on making cosmic rays measurements with the [HAWC Observatory](https://www.hawc-observatory.org/),
an experiment located near Puebla, Mexico on the slopes of Pico de Orizaba (pictured below).
I applied unfolding (deconvolution) techniques to measure the spectrum (publised in [PRD](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.96.122001)), 
collaborated in measuring the large and small scale anisotropy, 
and used the Earth''s magnetic field to validate our techniques via observation of the cosmic-ray Moon shadow.
